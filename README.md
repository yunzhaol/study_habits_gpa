# An analysis of Aerial Bombing Target Prioritization Against Germany of WWII

## Overview

The strategic targeting of military assets during World War II was crucial for the success of aerial bombing campaigns. Prioritizing targets effectively could have significant implications on the warâ€™s outcome. This study focuses on the aerial bombing campaigns against Germany, aiming to understand the factors influencing the prioritization of targets from an operational perspective.

We used a Bayesian ordered logistic regression model to analyze and the data is obtained from [Data World](https://data.world/datamil/world-war-ii-thor-data).


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from [Data World](https://data.world/datamil/world-war-ii-thor-data).
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper and datasheet. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean and model data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the paper and code were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in other/llm/usage.txt.
